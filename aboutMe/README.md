I am an Electrical & Computer Engineering student at the University of Washington with a strong interest in embedded systems, controls, and machine learning applied in medical devices and robotics.

I love working on projects that have a good mix of hands-on experience and coding because being able to physically hold the results and see my progress is rewarding to me. I want to bring aspects of electrical engineering to the field of health and medicine to create products that will help others, whether it be through medical devices or surgical robots.

I am flexible and adaptable when it comes to problem-solving, and I chose engineering because of how creative I can be when coming up with solutions to real-life problems. I would love any learning opportunities and connect with you to share my passion!
